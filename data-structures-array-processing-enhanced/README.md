# Array Manipulation Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various array manipulation algorithms in JavaScript, along with test cases and performance benchmarks.  Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations, time/space complexity analysis, and discussions of different approaches.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.
2. **Remove Duplicates:** Remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place.
3. **Max Subarray Sum:** Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum. (Kadane's Algorithm)
4. **Merge Intervals:** Given an array of intervals, merge overlapping intervals. (Requires a custom Interval class)
5. **Rotate Array:** Rotate an array by k positions to the right.


**Project Structure:**

- `algorithms.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test.js`: Test cases using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions (optional).
- `benchmark.js`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `algorithms_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations.


**To Run:**

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Run `npm install jest` to install the testing framework.
3.  Run `npm test` to run the test suite.
