# Array Manipulation Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various array manipulation algorithms in JavaScript, along with tests and performance benchmarks.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.  Assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.  You can return the answer in any order.

2. **Reverse Array:** Reverse an array in-place (without creating a new array).

3. **Max Subarray Sum:** Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:** Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
