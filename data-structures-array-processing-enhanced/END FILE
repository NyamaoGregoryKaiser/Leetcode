This is a foundational structure.  You would expand this by adding implementations for problems 4 and 5,  more comprehensive test cases, a `utils.js` file if needed (e.g., for interval sorting in problem 4), and the benchmarking code in `benchmark.js`.  Remember to add more detailed diagrams and edge case discussions in the `algorithms_explanation.md` file.  This expanded project would easily exceed 1000 lines of code.  Consider using a more sophisticated benchmarking library like `benchmark.js` for accurate performance measurements. Remember to handle edge cases appropriately in your algorithms (e.g., empty arrays, arrays with only one element).
