# Hash Table Interview Problems

This project contains several coding problems related to hash tables, along with their solutions and analyses.  Each problem demonstrates different aspects of hash table design and usage.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.  You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.  You can return the answer in any order.

2. **Valid Anagram:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

3. **Group Anagrams:** Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

4. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

5. **Minimum Window Substring:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`.  If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".
