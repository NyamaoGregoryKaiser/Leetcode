You'll need to substantially expand this with the remaining problem solutions, comprehensive test cases, performance benchmarks, documentation, and alternative implementations as outlined in the initial prompt.  Remember to handle edge cases (empty arrays, empty strings, etc.) thoroughly in your solutions.
