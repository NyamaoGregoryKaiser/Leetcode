Remember to install the `unittest` module if you don't have it already (it's usually included with Python).  This is a starting point; significantly expanding the tests, adding the `minimum_window_substring` function,  implementing brute-force alternatives, and incorporating performance benchmarks will increase the project's size and complexity to well over 1000 lines of code as requested.  Consider using a profiling tool to analyze performance bottlenecks and optimize further.  You can also explore different hash table implementations (e.g., using Python dictionaries directly or implementing separate chaining with linked lists). Remember to thoroughly document your code.
