This is a starting point.  You need to add the implementations for the remaining problems (Merge, Remove Nth, Palindrome), complete the testing, and add the benchmarking and other files as outlined in the README.  Remember to consider edge cases (empty lists, single-node lists, etc.) in your implementations and tests.  Adding different approaches (recursive, iterative, etc.) for each problem will make the project even more comprehensive.  Finally, diagrams would enhance the `algorithm_explanation.md`. Remember to install `jest` for testing:  `npm install --save-dev jest`  and configure your `package.json` to run jest.
