# Linked List Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various linked list algorithms in TypeScript, along with tests and performance benchmarks.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse Linked List:** Reverse a singly linked list.
2. **Detect Cycle:** Determine if a linked list contains a cycle (loop).
3. **Merge Two Sorted Lists:** Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
4. **Remove Nth Node From End:** Remove the nth node from the end of a linked list.
5. **Palindrome Linked List:** Check if a linked list is a palindrome.


## Project Structure:

- `linkedList.ts`: Main implementation of linked list algorithms.
- `linkedList.test.ts`: Test cases for linked list algorithms.
- `utils.ts`: Helper functions (e.g., creating linked lists).
- `benchmark.ts`: Performance benchmark code.
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations.


## Running the tests:

You'll need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.  Then:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to run the tests.
