# Linked List Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various Linked List algorithms in JavaScript.  Each problem includes multiple approaches (where applicable), time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

**Problems:**

1. **Reverse Linked List:** Reverse a singly linked list.
2. **Detect Cycle:** Determine if a linked list contains a cycle (loop).
3. **Merge Two Sorted Lists:** Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
4. **Remove Nth Node From End:** Remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list.
5. **Palindrome Linked List:** Check if a linked list is a palindrome.


**Project Structure:**

* `linkedList.js`: Contains the core Linked List implementation and algorithm functions.
* `test.js`: Contains Jest test cases for all algorithms.
* `algorithm_explanations.md`: Detailed explanations of the algorithms.


**To Run Tests:**

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
3. Run the tests: `npm test`
