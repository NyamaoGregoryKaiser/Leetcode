Remember to install the Google Test framework (`gtest`) to compile and run the test files.  This is a substantial starting point.  You should flesh out the Huffman Coding and Coin Change implementations, add more comprehensive test cases, and improve the documentation and benchmarking to reach the desired 1000+ lines of code.  Consider adding brute force approaches for comparison and exploring different programming paradigms (e.g., using different containers, implementing in Python for a contrast).
