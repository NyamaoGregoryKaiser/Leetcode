# Dynamic Programming Interview Project

This project contains implementations of several classic dynamic programming problems, showcasing different approaches and optimization techniques.

## Problems:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.  Includes iterative, recursive (with memoization), and bottom-up DP solutions.

2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the subset of items to include in a knapsack of a given capacity to maximize the total value. Includes both brute-force and DP solutions.

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (for simplicity, we'll focus on two sequences).  Includes a bottom-up DP solution.

4. **Coin Change:** Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the target amount. Includes DP and potentially a greedy approach for comparison.

5. **Edit Distance:** Find the minimum number of edits (insertion, deletion, substitution) needed to transform one string into another.  Includes a bottom-up DP solution.

## Project Structure:

- `src/`: Contains the main algorithm implementations.
