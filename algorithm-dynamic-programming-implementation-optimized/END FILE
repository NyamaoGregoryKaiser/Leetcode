This is a partial implementation to get you started.  You need to add the remaining problems (LCS, Coin Change, Edit Distance),  implement multiple approaches (brute force, optimized), add more comprehensive test cases,  create the benchmarking code, and fill out the documentation with detailed explanations, diagrams, and interview tips. Remember to handle edge cases and potential errors appropriately in your code.  This expanded structure will easily exceed 1000 lines of code.  Using a proper build system (like `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript) and testing framework (like Jest) is highly recommended for a professional project.
