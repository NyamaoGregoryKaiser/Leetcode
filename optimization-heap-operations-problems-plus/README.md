# Heap Operations Coding Interview Project

This project explores various heap operations and their applications through several coding challenges.  The goal is to demonstrate different approaches to solving these problems, analyze their time and space complexity, and highlight best practices.

## Problems:

1. **Heap Sort:** Implement heap sort algorithm.  Compare its performance against a standard sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort).
2. **Find Kth Largest Element:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array using a min-heap.
3. **Merge K Sorted Lists:** Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list using a min-heap.
4. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Find the top k frequent elements in an array.


## Project Structure:

* `heap_operations.py`: Main algorithm implementations.
* `test_heap.py`: Unit tests.
* `utils.py`: Helper functions and data structures (MinHeap class).
* `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code.
* `algorithms_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations and diagrams.


## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the tests using `pytest`.
3. Run the benchmark script to compare the performance of different algorithms.
