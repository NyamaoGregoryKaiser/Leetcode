This is a starting point.  To reach 1000+ lines, you would need to:

1. **Implement the remaining problems:**  "Merge K Sorted Lists" and "Top K Frequent Elements" require significantly more code.  These would involve managing linked lists and potentially using hash maps.
2. **Add more comprehensive test cases:**  Include edge cases, boundary conditions, and a wider range of inputs.
3. **Implement brute-force solutions:**  Show less efficient approaches for comparison.
4. **Add performance benchmarks:**  Measure the runtime of different algorithms using `timeit` or similar tools.
5. **Improve documentation:** Add more detailed explanations, diagrams (perhaps using a library like `matplotlib` for better visuals), and discuss trade-offs between different approaches.

Remember to install `pytest` (`pip install pytest`) for running the tests.  This expanded project will be a much more substantial coding challenge.
