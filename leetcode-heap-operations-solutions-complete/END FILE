Remember to add the solutions for problems 2-5 to `heap.js`, corresponding test cases to `test.js`, and relevant benchmarking code to `benchmark.js`. Also, complete the algorithm explanations and diagrams in their respective files. This expanded structure provides a solid foundation for your comprehensive heap operations project.  You'll need to fill in the missing code blocks to complete the project.  Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) if you choose to use it for testing.  Also consider using a linter like ESLint for improved code quality.
