# Heap Operations Coding Interview Project

This project contains various problems related to heap operations, implemented in JavaScript. Each problem includes multiple approaches with varying time and space complexities.

## Problems:

1. **Heap Sort:** Implement heap sort algorithm.  Analyze its time and space complexity.

2. **Find Kth Largest Element:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array using a min-heap.

3. **Merge K Sorted Arrays:** Merge k sorted arrays into a single sorted array efficiently using a min-heap.

4. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Find the top k most frequent elements in an array.

5. **Sliding Window Maximum:** Find the maximum value in each window of size k as it slides through an array.


## Project Structure:

- `heap.js`: Main implementation of heap data structure and algorithms.
- `test.js`: Unit tests using Jest or similar testing framework.
- `benchmark.js`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `bruteforce.js`: Brute force implementations for comparison.
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed explanation of algorithms.
- `diagrams.md`: Visual diagrams (ASCII art).

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if using a package manager).
3. Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.
4. Run `node benchmark.js` to perform benchmarking.
