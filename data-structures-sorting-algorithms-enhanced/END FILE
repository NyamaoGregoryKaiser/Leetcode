This is a substantial starting point for your project.  Remember to add more sophisticated linked list sorting, string sorting functions to `sorting_algorithms.py`,  expand the test cases in `test_sorting.py`, add more detailed documentation in `documentation.md` (including ASCII art diagrams), and potentially explore other sorting algorithms (e.g., Radix Sort, Counting Sort) to reach the 1000+ line code goal.  Remember to handle edge cases (empty arrays, arrays with duplicates, etc.) thoroughly in your code and tests.
