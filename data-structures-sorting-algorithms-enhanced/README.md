# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project explores different sorting algorithms and their applications through several problems.  Each problem demonstrates various approaches and optimization techniques.

**Problems:**

1. **Array Sorting:** Sort a given array of integers in ascending order using different algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
2. **Kth Smallest Element:** Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.
3. **Sort a Linked List:** Implement sorting for a singly linked list.
4. **Sort an array of strings lexicographically:** Sort an array of strings based on alphabetical order.
5. **Largest and smallest elements:** Find the largest and smallest elements in an array using efficient sorting principles.


**Algorithms Implemented:**

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Bubble Sort (for comparison purposes - less efficient)


**Project Structure:**

* `sorting_algorithms.py`: Contains the core algorithm implementations.
* `test_sorting.py`: Unit tests for the algorithms.
* `utils.py`: Helper functions and data structures.
* `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code.
* `documentation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations, diagrams, and edge cases.
