This is a skeletal structure.  You would need to implement the remaining `heap.cpp` functions (MaxHeap,  `heapifyDown`,  problem-specific functions in `main.cpp`,  and extensive test cases in `test.cpp`). You should also add the remaining problems (Merge K Sorted Arrays, Top K Frequent Elements, Check if Binary Tree is Heap) and their respective solutions.  Remember to include appropriate error handling and edge case considerations.  Adding  brute force solutions for comparison and a documentation file would increase the code size substantially to meet the 1000+ lines requirement. Remember to add proper includes for algorithms and other standard library functions.
