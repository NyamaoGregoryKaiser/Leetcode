# Greedy Algorithms Coding Interview Project

This project contains implementations of several classic greedy algorithm problems, showcasing different approaches and complexities.  Each problem includes optimal solutions, brute-force comparisons, and analyses of time and space complexity.

## Problems:

1. **Fractional Knapsack:** Given a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity and a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack by selecting fractions of items.

2. **Huffman Coding:** Construct an optimal prefix-free binary code for a given set of characters and their frequencies using Huffman's algorithm.

3. **Activity Selection:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed.

4. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins):** Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations.  (Greedy approach may not always yield optimal solution for all coin sets)


## Project Structure:

- `greedy_algorithms.cpp`: Main implementation of greedy algorithms.
- `test_greedy.cpp`: Test cases for the algorithms.
- `utils.h`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.cpp`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `docs/`: Documentation (Algorithm explanations, diagrams, edge cases)


## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the test cases and benchmark code.
