# Dynamic Programming Interview Project

This project contains solutions to various dynamic programming problems, showcasing different approaches and optimization techniques.

## Problems:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.  Includes iterative and recursive (with memoization) solutions.

2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the length of the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (primarily focusing on two sequences).

## Project Structure:

- `dp_algorithms.py`: Contains the main dynamic programming algorithm implementations.
- `test_dp.py`: Unit tests for the algorithms.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions (e.g., timer).
- `documentation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations, diagrams, edge cases.


## Running the Tests:

```bash
python -m unittest test_dp.py
```
