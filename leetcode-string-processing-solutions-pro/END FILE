This is a starting point. You would need to add more sophisticated test cases,  implement the optimized solutions for longest palindromic substring (e.g., using dynamic programming or Manacher's algorithm),  add brute-force versions for comparison, include different programming paradigms (e.g., a recursive approach for palindrome checking),  memory-efficient versions where applicable,  and expand the documentation significantly to complete the project as requested.  Remember to compile with a C++ compiler (like g++) using  `g++ string_manipulation.cpp test_string_manipulation.cpp -o test` and then run with `./test`.
