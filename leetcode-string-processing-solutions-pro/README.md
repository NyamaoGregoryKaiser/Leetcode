# String Manipulation Coding Interview Project

This project contains several string manipulation problems commonly encountered in coding interviews, along with their optimized solutions and various approaches.  Each problem includes test cases and performance benchmarks.

**Problems:**

1. **Reverse String:** Reverse a given string.
2. **Palindrome Check:** Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).
3. **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.
4. **String Permutation:** Check if two strings are permutations of each other.
5. **Remove Duplicate Characters:** Remove duplicate characters from a string while maintaining order.
