This is a starting point.  You need to complete the implementation of the remaining algorithms (`Rotate Array`, `Merge Sorted Arrays`, `Find Peak Element`), add comprehensive test cases,  create the `utils.js` and `benchmark.js` files (optional but recommended), and most importantly,  the documentation in the `docs/` folder.  Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) for running the tests.  The documentation should include clear explanations, diagrams (you can use markdown for simple ASCII art), and discussions of edge cases and potential interview follow-up questions.  Consider adding brute force and optimized versions for each problem, along with memory-efficient solutions where applicable.  This project should easily exceed 1000 lines of code with thorough implementation and documentation.
