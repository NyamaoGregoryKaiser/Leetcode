# Array Manipulation Algorithms

This project contains implementations of several array manipulation algorithms with different approaches, including brute force and optimized solutions.  Each algorithm includes time and space complexity analysis, test cases, and documentation.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
2. **Remove Duplicates:** Remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place.
3. **Rotate Array:** Rotate an array by k positions.
4. **Merge Sorted Arrays:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
5. **Find Peak Element:** Find a peak element in a mountain array (an array that strictly increases then strictly decreases).


**Project Structure:**

- `algorithm.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test.js`: Test cases using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions (optional).
- `benchmark.js`: Performance benchmarking (optional).
- `docs/`: Algorithm explanations, diagrams, and edge cases.
