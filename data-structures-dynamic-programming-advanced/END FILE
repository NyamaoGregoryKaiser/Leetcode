This is a starting point.  You need to add more test cases, implement the remaining problems (as outlined in the README), add performance benchmarking, create the documentation (algorithm explanations, diagrams, etc.), and explore additional implementations (brute force, different programming paradigms, memory-efficient versions). Remember to use a testing framework like Jest.  This expanded project will easily exceed 1000 lines of code. Remember to handle edge cases and potential errors appropriately in your code.
