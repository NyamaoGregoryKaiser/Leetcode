# Dynamic Programming Interview Project

This project contains several classic dynamic programming problems implemented in JavaScript.  Each problem includes multiple solutions (brute-force, optimized DP) with time/space complexity analysis.

**Problems:**

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the length of the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (here, we'll focus on two sequences).
4. **Coin Change:** Find**Project Structure:**

- `src/`: Contains the main algorithm implementations.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests.
- `utils/`: Contains helper functions and data structures.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation and diagrams.
