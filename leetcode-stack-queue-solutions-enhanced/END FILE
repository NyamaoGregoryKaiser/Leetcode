This is a partial implementation. You need to add the solutions for problems 3, 4, and 5 to `src/stacksAndQueues.ts` and corresponding test cases to `test/stacksAndQueues.test.ts`. Remember to install a testing framework like Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest` and configure it in your `package.json`.  You'll also need to add the documentation (`docs/`), helper utilities (`utils/`), and potentially benchmarking code. This expanded structure will easily exceed 1000 lines of code.  Remember to handle edge cases and different input scenarios thoroughly in both your code and tests.
