# Stack and Queue Coding Interview Problems

This project contains various problems related to Stack and Queue data structures, implemented in TypeScript.  Each problem includes multiple approaches, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

## Problems:

1. **Valid Parentheses:** Given a string containing parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`, determine if the input string is valid.  An input string is valid if:
    - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    - Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

2. **Queue using Stacks:** Implement a queue data structure using two stacks.

3. **Reverse a Queue:** Reverse the elements of a queue without using any extra data structure.

4. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:** Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the largest rectangular area that can be formed by the bars.

5. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):** Evaluate an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation).
