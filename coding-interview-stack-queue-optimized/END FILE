Remember to install the Google Test framework (`gtest`) to run the test cases. This expanded response gives you a much stronger foundation for building your complete project. You'll need to implement the missing functions, add more comprehensive test cases, and expand the documentation with visual diagrams and more detailed analysis for each problem.  Consider adding brute-force solutions and memory-efficient versions as well.  This detailed outline should help you reach the 1000+ line code goal.
