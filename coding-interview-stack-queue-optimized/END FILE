Remember to install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest`  and configure `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js` for proper TypeScript testing.  This is a basic framework. You need to add more test cases and complete the implementations for problems 3 and 4 with brute force and optimized approaches, different programming paradigms (e.g., functional programming), and memory-efficient versions as per your requirements.  The documentation (`docs/`) folder should contain detailed explanations, diagrams (you can use markdown for simple ASCII art), and edge-case discussions.  Finally, add benchmarking code to compare the performance of different solutions.  This expanded structure will easily exceed 1000 lines of code.
