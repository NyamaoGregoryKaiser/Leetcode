# Stack and Queue Interview Problems

This project contains implementations and solutions for several common interview problems involving stacks and queues.  Each problem includes multiple approaches, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

## Problems:

1. **Valid Parentheses:**  Given a string containing parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
    * Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    * Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    * Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket.

2. **Queue using Stacks:** Implement a queue data structure using two stacks.  Should include `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods.

3. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:** Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed.

4. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):** Evaluate an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation).
