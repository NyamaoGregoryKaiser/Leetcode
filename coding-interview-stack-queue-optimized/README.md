# Stack and Queue Coding Interview Problems

This project contains implementations of several classic problems involving stacks and queues, along with multiple approaches and performance analyses.  Each problem includes test cases and documentation.

**Problems:**

1. **Valid Parentheses:** Given a string containing parentheses, brackets, and braces, determine if it is valid.
2. **Queue using Stacks:** Implement a queue using two stacks.
3. **Stack using Queues:** Implement a stack using two queues.
4. **Reverse a Queue:** Reverse the order of elements in a queue.
5. **Largest Rectangular Area in Histogram:** Find the largest rectangular area in a histogram represented as an array of heights.


**Project Structure:**

* `stack_queue.cpp`: Main algorithm implementations.
* `test_stack_queue.cpp`: Test cases.
* `utils.h`: Helper functions and data structures.
* `benchmark.cpp`: Performance benchmarking code.
* `documentation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations and diagrams.
