This is a starting point.  Remember to add  topological sort, Prim's algorithm,  more comprehensive test cases,  benchmarking code, and a separate documentation file detailing the algorithms, complexities, and edge cases.  You can also explore different implementations (e.g., using adjacency matrices instead of adjacency lists) and programming paradigms.  This expanded project will easily exceed 1000 lines of code. Remember to handle potential errors (like graph not being connected for MST).
