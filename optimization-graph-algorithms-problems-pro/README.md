# Graph Algorithms Interview Project

This project contains implementations of several graph algorithms, along with tests and documentation.  Each problem includes different approaches, ranging from brute-force to optimized solutions.

**Problems:**

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Find the shortest path from a source node to all other reachable nodes.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverse a graph using DFS, detecting cycles and connected components.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
4. **Topological Sort:**  Order the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering.
5. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):** Find a minimum-weight spanning tree for a connected, weighted, undirected graph.


**Project Structure:**

- `graph_algorithms.py`: Main implementation of graph algorithms.
- `test_graph_algorithms.py`: Test cases for the algorithms.
- `graph.py`:  Graph data structure implementation.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions.
