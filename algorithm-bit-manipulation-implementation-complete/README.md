# Bit Manipulation Coding Interview Project

This project contains several bit manipulation problems with various solutions, focusing on optimized approaches and thorough testing.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse Bits:** Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.
2. **Count Set Bits:** Count the number of set bits (1s) in an unsigned integer.  Include solutions using built-in functions and bit manipulation.
3. **Find the Two Non-Repeating Numbers:** Given an array where every element appears twice except for two, find the two that appear only once.
4. **Single Number III:** Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears once. Find that single element.
5. **Power of Two:** Determine if a given integer is a power of two.


## Project Structure:
