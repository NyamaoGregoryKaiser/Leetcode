Remember to add more comprehensive test cases, detailed algorithm explanations, and diagrams to complete this project.  You should also consider adding brute force solutions for comparison and exploring different programming paradigms like functional programming (if appropriate).  Finally, consider adding performance benchmarks to compare the efficiency of different approaches.  This detailed outline provides a strong foundation to build your complete project.
