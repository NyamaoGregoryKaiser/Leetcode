# Linked List Interview Problems

This project contains several common linked list problems with various solutions.  Each problem includes optimized solutions, test cases, and performance analysis.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse a Linked List:** Reverse the order of nodes in a singly linked list.
2. **Detect a Cycle (Cycle Detection):** Determine if a linked list contains a cycle.
3. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists:** Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
4. **Remove Nth Node From End of List:** Remove the nth node from the end of a linked list.
5. **Find Middle Node of Linked List:** Find the middle node of a singly linked list.
