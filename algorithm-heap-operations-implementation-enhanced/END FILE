This is a skeletal structure. You need to add the `merge_k_sorted_lists` and `meeting_rooms_ii` functions (which require defining `ListNode` and `Interval` classes respectively), expand the test suite, add benchmarking code, and create the documentation files (`docs/`) as described in the README.  Remember to handle edge cases (empty arrays, empty heaps, etc.) thoroughly in your implementations.  This expanded structure will easily reach 1000+ lines of code.  Consider adding brute force solutions for comparison and exploring different heap implementations for further enrichment.
