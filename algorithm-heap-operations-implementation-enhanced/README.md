# Heap Operations Coding Interview Project

This project contains implementations and solutions for several coding interview problems related to heap data structures.  Each problem includes optimized solutions with time and space complexity analysis, along with test cases.

**Problems:**

1. **Heap Sort:** Sort an array using a heap data structure.
2. **Find Kth Largest Element:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
3. **Merge K Sorted Lists:** Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
4. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Find the top k frequent elements in an array.
5. **Meeting Rooms II:** Given an array of meeting time intervals, determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required.


**Project Structure:**

- `heap.py`: Implementation of min-heap and max-heap data structures.
- `problems.py`: Solutions to the coding interview problems.
- `test_problems.py`: Unit tests for the problem solutions.
- `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code (optional).
- `docs/`: Algorithm explanations, diagrams, and interview tips.


**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the tests: `python -m unittest test_problems.py`
