# Sorting Algorithms Interview Project

This project explores various sorting algorithms and their applications through several problems.  Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.

**Problems:**

1. **Array Sorting:** Sort an array of integers in ascending order. Explore different algorithms like Merge Sort, QuickSort, and HeapSort.
2. **Kth Smallest Element:** Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.  Consider using QuickSelect or a Heap-based approach.
3. **Sort a Linked List:** Sort a singly linked list using Merge Sort or other suitable algorithms.
4. **Sorting Almost Sorted Array:** Sort an array where most elements are already in their correct positions.  Analyze the efficiency of different algorithms in this scenario.
5. **Sort a Stack:** Sort a stack using only stack operations (push, pop, peek).


**Project Structure:**

- `src/`: Contains source code for algorithm implementations.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for each algorithm.
