Remember to install the Google Test framework (`gtest`) to run the unit tests.  This is a basic framework, and you need to significantly expand it to meet the 1000+ lines of code requirement and include more sophisticated testing,  brute-force vs. optimized solutions,  different programming paradigms (e.g., functional programming aspects where applicable), and memory-efficient versions (especially relevant for linked lists and large datasets).  Add more detailed comments and error handling throughout the code.  Remember to create the necessary file structure and include all necessary headers.
