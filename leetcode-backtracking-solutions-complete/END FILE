This is a simplified example.  You would need to:

* **Fully implement** the remaining backtracking problems (Sudoku, Permutations, Combinations).
* **Add comprehensive test cases** to cover various scenarios, including edge cases and invalid inputs.
* **Implement helper functions** (e.g., for printing boards, managing data structures).
* **Create more detailed documentation** with diagrams, complexity analysis, and interview tips.
* **Explore different approaches** (e.g., iterative vs. recursive backtracking, memory optimization techniques).
* **Add performance benchmarking code.**


Remember to use a package manager like npm or yarn to manage dependencies for testing frameworks (like Jest) and other utilities.  This detailed outline will allow you to build a substantial and complete project.
