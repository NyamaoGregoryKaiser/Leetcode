# Backtracking Algorithm Project

This project explores the backtracking algorithm through several classic problems.  Each problem includes multiple approaches, optimized solutions, and performance analysis.

## Problems:

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subset Sum:** Find all subsets of a given array whose elements sum to a target value.
3. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.
4. **Permutations:** Generate all unique permutations of a given string.
5. **Combinations:** Generate all combinations of k elements from a set of n elements.

## Project Structure:

- `src/`: Contains the main algorithm implementations.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests.
- `utils/`: Contains helper functions and data structures.
- `docs/`: Contains algorithm explanations and diagrams.
