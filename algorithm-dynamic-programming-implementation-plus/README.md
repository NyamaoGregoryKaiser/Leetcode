# Dynamic Programming Interview Project

This project contains implementations of several classic dynamic programming problems, showcasing different approaches and optimization techniques.

## Problems:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.  Includes iterative, recursive (with memoization), and bottom-up DP solutions.

2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the length of the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (will focus on 2 sequences for simplicity).

4. **Coin Change:**  Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

5. **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance):** Find the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.
