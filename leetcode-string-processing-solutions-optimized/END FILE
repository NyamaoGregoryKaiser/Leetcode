This is a skeletal structure.  To make it a truly comprehensive project, you would need to expand the test suite significantly, add more sophisticated helper functions, explore brute-force vs. optimized approaches,  include performance benchmarking, and potentially implement solutions in other languages or paradigms (e.g., functional programming). Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) to run the tests.  Run tests with `npm test`.  This expanded project would easily exceed 1000 lines of code.  This example provides a solid foundation for building upon.
