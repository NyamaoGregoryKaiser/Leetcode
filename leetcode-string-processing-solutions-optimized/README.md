# String Manipulation Algorithms

This project contains implementations of several string manipulation algorithms in JavaScript.  Each algorithm includes optimized solutions, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse String:** Reverse a given string.
2. **Palindrome Check:** Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).
3. **Anagram Check:** Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters, but possibly in a different order).
4. **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.
5. **String Compression:**  Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".


## Project Structure:

- `string_manipulation.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test.js`: Unit tests using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions (optional).
