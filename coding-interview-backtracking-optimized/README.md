# Backtracking Algorithms Project

This project explores several problems solvable using backtracking, a powerful algorithmic technique for exploring solutions by incrementally building candidates and abandoning them ("backtracking") if they fail to satisfy constraints.

**Problems Included:**

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subsets:** Generate all possible subsets of a given set.
3. **Permutations:** Generate all possible permutations of a given list.
4. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.
5. **Combination Sum:** Find all unique combinations of numbers from a candidate list that sum to a target value.


**Project Structure:**

- `backtracking.py`: Contains the core backtracking algorithm implementations.
- `test_backtracking.py`: Unit tests for the algorithms.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code (to be implemented).
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed explanation of backtracking.

**To Run:**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install required packages (if any).
3.  Run the tests using `python -m unittest test_backtracking.py`.
