# Backtracking Algorithm Explanation

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all solutions to a problem by systematically trying every possible candidate.  It's particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

**Core Idea:**

The algorithm explores a tree-like structure where each node represents a partial solution.  It explores branches recursively.  If a branch leads to an invalid solution (violating constraints), it backtracks (goes back up the tree) to explore other branches.

**Steps:**

1. **Start with an empty solution:** Begin with an initial state (e.g., an empty chessboard for N-Queens).
2. **Explore options:** At each step, explore all possible choices that can extend the current partial solution.
3. **Check constraints:** Check if the new partial solution is valid (satisfies all constraints).
4. **Recursive call:** If valid, recursively call the function with the updated solution.
5. **Backtrack:** If invalid or if a complete solution is found, backtrack to the previous state and try a different choice.

**Example (N-Queens):**

The algorithm tries placing a queen in each column of the first row.  For each placement, it checks if it's safe (no other queen threatens it). If safe, it recursively places queens in the subsequent rows. If a placement is unsafe, it backtracks and tries the next column in the current row.  This continues until all rows are filled or all possibilities are exhausted.
