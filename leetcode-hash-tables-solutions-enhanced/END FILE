Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) to run the tests: `npx jest`.  This is a skeletal structure.  You can significantly expand this project by adding more problems, different hash table implementations (open addressing, etc.),  brute-force solutions for comparison, more comprehensive tests, and detailed algorithm explanation documents.  Visual diagrams would best be added as separate image files and referenced in the documentation. Remember to handle edge cases (empty inputs, null values, etc.) robustly in your code.
