This is a partial implementation.  You need to complete the `Algorithms.java` file with the remaining algorithms (Prim's, Topological Sort, Kosaraju's, Cycle Detection) and add comprehensive test cases in `TestAlgorithms.java`.  Remember to add a `Benchmark.java` file for performance testing and a `Documentation.md` file with detailed explanations and diagrams.  Consider adding different graph representations (adjacency matrix) and exploring brute-force solutions for comparison.  This expanded project will easily surpass 1000 lines of code.  Remember to include necessary testing frameworks (like JUnit) in your project's dependencies.
