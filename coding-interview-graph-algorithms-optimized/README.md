# Graph Algorithms Interview Project

This project contains implementations of various graph algorithms, along with test cases and performance benchmarks.  It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for practicing graph algorithms in the context of coding interviews.

**Problems:**

1. **Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm):** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):** Find a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
3. **Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm):**  Find a topological ordering of nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
4. **Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algorithm):** Identify strongly connected components in a directed graph.
5. **Cycle Detection (DFS):** Determine if a directed or undirected graph contains a cycle.

**Structure:**

- `Graph.java`:  Implementation of the graph data structure.
- `Algorithms.java`: Implementation of graph algorithms.
- `TestAlgorithms.java`: Unit tests for the algorithms.
- `Benchmark.java`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `Documentation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations, diagrams, and edge cases.
