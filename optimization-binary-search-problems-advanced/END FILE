Remember to fill in the missing implementations in `binary_search.js` and add more comprehensive test cases in `test.js`.  You can use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.  This expanded framework will help you create a complete project exceeding 1000 lines of code. Remember to adjust the complexity of the problems and add more variations to reach the desired code length.  You can also include different programming paradigms (e.g., recursive implementations) as outlined in the initial request.
