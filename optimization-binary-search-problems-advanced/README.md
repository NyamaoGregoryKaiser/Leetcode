# Binary Search Project

This project explores the Binary Search algorithm and its variations through several problems and solutions.  It includes implementations in JavaScript, test cases, performance benchmarks, and documentation.

## Problems:

1. **Standard Binary Search:** Find the index of a target element in a sorted array.
2. **First/Last Occurrence:** Find the index of the first and last occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.
3. **Find Closest Element:** Find the element in a sorted array that is closest to a given target value.
4. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array:** Find a target element in a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot point.
5. **Find Peak Element:** Find a peak element in a mountain array (an array that first increases and then decreases).


## Project Structure:

* `binary_search.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
* `test.js`: Test suite using Jest (or your preferred testing framework).
* `utils.js`: Helper functions (e.g., array generation).
* `benchmark.js`: Performance benchmark code.
* `documentation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanation and edge cases.


## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (Jest).
3. Run `npm test` to run the test suite.
4. Run `node benchmark.js` to run performance benchmarks.
