# Backtracking Algorithms Project

This project explores several classic backtracking problems, demonstrating different approaches and optimization techniques.  Each problem includes multiple solutions, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

## Problems:

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subset Sum:** Given a set of integers, find all subsets that sum to a given target value.
3. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.
4. **Permutation Generator:** Generate all permutations of a given string.
5. **Graph Coloring:**  Color the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color (using a limited number of colors).


## Project Structure:

- `src/`: Contains Java source code for algorithms and tests.
- `docs/`: Contains algorithm explanations, diagrams, and interview tips.
- `test/`: Contains JUnit test files.
