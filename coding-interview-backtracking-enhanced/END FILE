**(Remember to add the remaining problem implementations (Sudoku, Permutations, Graph Coloring), comprehensive test cases, and documentation files as outlined in the README.  You will also need to add necessary helper classes and potentially external libraries for graph representation and visualization.  This expanded project will easily exceed 1000 lines of code.)**


This structure provides a robust starting point. Remember to thoroughly test your code and consider adding features like performance benchmarking and different algorithm implementations (e.g., iterative vs. recursive) to make this a truly comprehensive project.  The complexity of fully implementing all aspects within this response is prohibitive.  Use this as a template to expand your project.
