This is a starting point. You can add more problems (e.g., string compression, anagram detection, regular expression matching), more solutions per problem (brute-force, dynamic programming, etc.), more comprehensive tests, and detailed documentation as described in your request to make it a larger project.  Remember to add proper error handling and input validation to make it production-ready.  Also consider adding visualizations (perhaps using a library) to enhance your documentation.
