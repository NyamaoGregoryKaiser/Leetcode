# String Manipulation Coding Interview Project

This project contains several string manipulation problems commonly encountered in coding interviews. Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.  The goal is to demonstrate different approaches and best practices.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse String:** Reverse a given string.
2. **Palindrome Check:** Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).
3. **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.


## Project Structure:

- `StringManip.java`: Main algorithm implementation.
- `StringManipTest.java`: Unit tests.
- `utils/Timer.java`: Helper class for benchmarking.
