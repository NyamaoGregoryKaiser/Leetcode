# String Manipulation Coding Interview Project

This project contains several string manipulation problems commonly encountered in coding interviews. Each problem includes optimal solutions with time and space complexity analysis, along with test cases.

## Problems:

1. **Reverse String:** Reverse a given string.  Consider both in-place and non-in-place solutions.

2. **Palindrome Check:** Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). Ignore case and non-alphanumeric characters.

3. **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.

4. **String Compression:** Implement a method to perform basic string compression using counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".

5. **Anagram Check:** Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters, but not necessarily in the same order).

## Project Structure:

- `string_manipulation.py`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test_string_manipulation.py`: Unit tests.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions (optional).
- `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code (optional).
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations.
