Remember to install the Google Test framework (`gtest`) to run the unit tests.  This is a starting point;  you can expand it significantly by adding more problems, brute-force solutions, different programming paradigms, detailed benchmarking, and more comprehensive documentation and visualizations.  For Huffman Coding, you'll need to implement the tree traversal and code generation.  Similarly, you can add dynamic programming solutions for the coin change problem for optimal results.
