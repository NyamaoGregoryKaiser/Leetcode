# Greedy Algorithms Project

This project explores several classic greedy algorithm problems, showcasing optimal solutions and comparing them to brute-force approaches. Each problem includes detailed explanations, test cases, and performance analysis.

**Problems:**

1. **Fractional Knapsack:**  Maximize the value of items selected given a weight constraint, allowing fractional item selection.
2. **Huffman Coding:** Construct an optimal prefix-free binary code for a given set of characters and their frequencies.
3. **Activity Selection:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
4. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins):** Find the minimum number of coins to represent a given amount using a given set of coin denominations.


**Project Structure:**

- `greedy_algorithms.cpp`: Main implementation of greedy algorithms.
- `test_greedy.cpp`: Unit tests for the implemented algorithms.
- `utils.h`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.cpp`:  Performance benchmarking code.
- `algorithms_explanation.md`: Detailed explanation of the algorithms.
