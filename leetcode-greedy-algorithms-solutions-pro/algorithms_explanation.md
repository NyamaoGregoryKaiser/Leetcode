# Greedy Algorithm Explanations

This document provides detailed explanations of the greedy algorithms implemented in this project.

**1. Fractional Knapsack:**

* **Algorithm:**  Sorts items by value-to-weight ratio and selects items greedily until the knapsack is full.  Allows fractional parts of items.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding input array)

**2. Huffman Coding:**

* **Algorithm:** Builds a Huffman tree by repeatedly merging nodes with the lowest frequencies.  The codes are then generated by traversing the tree.  (Implementation omitted for brevity in this example)
* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)

**3. Activity Selection:**

* **Algorithm:** Sorts activities by finish time and selects activities greedily, ensuring no overlap.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding input array)

**4. Coin Change (Minimum Coins):**

* **Algorithm:** Uses a greedy approach by selecting the largest possible coin at each step.  Note: this greedy approach doesn't guarantee the optimal solution for all coin denominations.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n*k), where n is the amount and k is the number of denominations.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
