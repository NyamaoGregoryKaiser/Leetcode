# Backtracking Algorithms Project

This project explores backtracking algorithms through several classic problems.  Each problem includes multiple solution approaches with varying levels of optimization.

**Problems:**

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subsets:** Generate all possible subsets of a given set.
3. **Permutations:** Generate all unique permutations of a given string.
4. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.
5. **Combination Sum:** Find all unique combinations in a candidate set whose sum equals a target number.


**Project Structure:**

- `backtracking.py`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test_backtracking.py`: Unit tests.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking.
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed explanation of backtracking.


**To Run:**

1. Install Python 3.
2. Run the tests: `python -m unittest test_backtracking.py`
3. Run the benchmark: `python benchmark.py`
