Remember to add the Sudoku solver and Combination Sum functions to `backtracking.py` and corresponding test cases to `test_backtracking.py`.  You'll also need to expand the `algorithm_explanation.md`, `benchmark.py`, and `utils.py` files to complete the project.  This expanded framework provides a much stronger basis for a complete backtracking project.  Remember to add thorough error handling and input validation to make the code robust.
