# Backtracking Algorithm Explanation

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all solutions to a problem. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.

**Key Concepts:**

* **State Space:** The set of all possible partial solutions.
* **Exploration:**  Building partial solutions incrementally.
* **Pruning:**  Discarding partial solutions that cannot lead to a valid solution.

**Example (N-Queens):**

The N-Queens problem illustrates backtracking beautifully. The state space is all possible arrangements of queens on the board.  We explore by placing queens one by one. We prune a partial solution if we place a queen that attacks an already placed queen.
