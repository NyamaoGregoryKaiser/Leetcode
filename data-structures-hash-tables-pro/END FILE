Remember to fill in the missing implementations for the hash table methods, the problem solutions in `main.cpp`, and write comprehensive test cases in `tests.cpp`.  Add a `benchmark.cpp` file to compare the performance of different approaches.  Finally, create a detailed `documentation.md` file with explanations, diagrams, and interview tips.  This expanded structure provides a solid foundation for a substantial coding interview project on hash tables.  You will need to install a testing framework like Google Test to run the tests. Remember to compile and link appropriately for your chosen compiler.
