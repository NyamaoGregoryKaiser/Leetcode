# Hash Table Interview Project

This project contains implementations of various hash table algorithms and problems frequently encountered in coding interviews. Each problem includes multiple approaches with varying time and space complexity.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.
2. **Valid Anagram:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.
3. **Group Anagrams:** Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
4. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
5. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.


**Project Structure:**

* `hash_table.h`: Header file for hash table implementation.
* `hash_table.cpp`: Implementation of hash table data structure.
* `main.cpp`: Main program containing problem solutions.
* `tests.cpp`: Unit tests for the hash table and problem solutions.
* `benchmark.cpp`: Benchmarking code to compare different implementations.
* `documentation.md`: Detailed documentation, including algorithm explanations, visual diagrams, edge cases, and interview tips.
