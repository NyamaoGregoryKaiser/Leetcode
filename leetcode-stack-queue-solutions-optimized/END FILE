This is a simplified version.  To make it a complete 1000+ line project, you should:

* Add more sophisticated test cases in `test.cpp`.
* Implement more efficient solutions for problems like the largest rectangle in a histogram (using a stack for O(n) time complexity).
* Add a performance benchmarking section to compare the different approaches.
* Expand the README with more details and diagrams.
* Include additional implementation files showcasing brute force vs. optimized solutions, different programming paradigms (e.g., using linked lists instead of vectors), and memory-efficient versions.


Remember to compile using a C++ compiler (like g++):  `g++ main.cpp test.cpp -o main` (assuming you have created a `test.cpp` file).  You might need to adjust the compilation command depending on your setup and include directories.
