# Hash Table Interview Project

This project contains several common hash table problems with various solutions and analyses.

## Problems:

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.  You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.  You can return the answer in any order.

2. **Valid Anagram:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

3. **Group Anagrams:** Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

4. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
