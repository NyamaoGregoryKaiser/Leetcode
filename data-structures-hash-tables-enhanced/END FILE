Remember to install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`  and run the tests with `npm test`.  This is a skeletal example; you need to add more comprehensive test cases and potentially expand the `utils.js` file with a more robust hashing strategy for collision handling to make it a truly complete project.  You can also add brute force solutions and different programming paradigms to reach the 1000+ lines of code target.  Add more detailed comments and diagrams to improve the readability and understanding of your implementation.
