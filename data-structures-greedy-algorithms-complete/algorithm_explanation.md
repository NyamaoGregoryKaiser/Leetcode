# Greedy Algorithm Explanations

This document provides detailed explanations of the greedy algorithms implemented in this project.

**1. Fractional Knapsack:**

* **Algorithm:**  Sorts items by value-to-weight ratio and greedily takes as much of each item as possible until the knapsack is full.
* **Diagram:**
```
+-----------------+
| Knapsack (50)   |
+-----------------+
Item 1 (60,10)  --->  Taken fully
Item 2 (100,20) --->  Taken fully
Item 3 (120,30) --->  Taken partially (20/30)
```
* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)


**2. Huffman Coding:**
