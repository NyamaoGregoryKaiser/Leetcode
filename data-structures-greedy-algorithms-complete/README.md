# Greedy Algorithms Project

This project demonstrates several classic greedy algorithm problems with their optimal solutions and alternative approaches.  Each problem includes time and space complexity analysis, test cases, and considerations for edge cases.

**Problems Included:**

1. **Fractional Knapsack:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack with a weight limit.
2. **Huffman Coding:** Construct a Huffman tree to generate optimal variable-length prefix codes for a set of characters with given frequencies.
3. **Activity Selection:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
4. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins):** Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations.


**Project Structure:**

- `greedy_algorithms.py`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test_greedy_algorithms.py`: Unit tests.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations and diagrams.
