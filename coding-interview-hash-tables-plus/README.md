# Hash Table Coding Interview Problems

This project contains several coding problems focusing on the use of hash tables. Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.

**Problems:**

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.  Assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.  You can return the answer in any order.

2. **Valid Anagram:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

3. **Group Anagrams:** Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

4. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

**Project Structure:**

- `hash_table.h`: Header file for hash table implementation.
- `hash_table.cpp`: Implementation of hash table.
- `main.cpp`: Main program containing problem solutions.
- `test.cpp`: Test cases for each problem.
- `benchmark.cpp`: Performance benchmarking code (optional).
