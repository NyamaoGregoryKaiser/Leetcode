This is a more complete starting point. Remember to compile and run this code using a C++ compiler (like g++).  You can then expand on this by adding more sophisticated testing, benchmarking, and alternative implementations as requested in your original prompt.  Remember to handle potential errors and edge cases (like empty input arrays) more robustly in a production environment.
