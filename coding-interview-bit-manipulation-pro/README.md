# Bit Manipulation Coding Interview Project

This project contains several bit manipulation problems commonly encountered in coding interviews, along with their optimal solutions and analyses.

**Problems:**

1. **Reverse Bits:** Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.
2. **Count Set Bits:** Count the number of set bits (1s) in an unsigned integer.
3. **Find the only non-repeating element:** Find the single element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice. (Using XOR)
4. **Check if a number is a power of 2:** Determine if a given positive integer is a power of 2.
5. **Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable:** Swap the values of two integer variables without using a temporary variable (using bitwise operations).


**Project Structure:**

- `bitManipulation.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test.js`: Test cases using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions (optional).


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Run `npm install jest` to install the testing framework.
3.  Run `npm test` to execute the test cases.
