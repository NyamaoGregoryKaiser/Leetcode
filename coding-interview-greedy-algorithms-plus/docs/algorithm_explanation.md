# Greedy Algorithm Explanations

## Fractional Knapsack

**Explanation:**  The fractional knapsack problem allows taking fractions of items. The greedy approach sorts items by their value-to-weight ratio and takes as much as possible of the highest-ratio items until the knapsack is full.

## Huffman Coding

**Explanation:** Huffman coding builds a binary tree based on character frequencies.  Characters with higher frequencies are placed closer to the root, resulting in shorter codes for more frequent characters.

## Activity Selection

**Explanation:** The greedy approach sorts activities by their finish times and selects activities that don't overlap.


## Coin Change (Greedy)

**Explanation:** This greedy approach only works under certain conditions on the coin denominations.  It selects the largest possible coin at each step.  It's *not* a general solution for all coin denomination sets.
