This is a partial implementation.  You need to:

1. **Complete the Huffman Coding implementation:** This requires a priority queue data structure.
2. **Add comprehensive test cases:**  Thoroughly test all functions with various inputs, including edge cases (empty arrays, zero capacity, etc.).
3. **Implement brute-force solutions:**  For comparison, create brute-force versions of the problems (especially for Knapsack and Coin Change).
4. **Add performance benchmarking:** Use tools like `console.time` or a dedicated benchmarking library to measure the performance of different approaches.
5. **Expand the documentation:**  Include detailed explanations, diagrams, and edge cases for each problem.  Add interview tips and potential variations of the problems.
6. **Consider different programming paradigms:** Explore functional programming approaches for some problems.
7. **Explore memory-efficient versions:** For large inputs, optimize memory usage.


Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) for testing.  You can then run tests with `npm test`.  This expanded structure will help you create a substantial project exceeding 1000 lines of code.
