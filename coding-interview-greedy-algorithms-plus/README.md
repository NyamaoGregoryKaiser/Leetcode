# Greedy Algorithms Coding Interview Project

This project explores various greedy algorithm problems with multiple approaches and optimizations. Each problem includes optimal solutions, brute-force comparisons, and performance benchmarking.

**Problems:**

1. **Fractional Knapsack:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack of a given capacity.  (Allows fractional items)

2. **Huffman Coding:** Construct an optimal prefix-free binary code for a given set of characters and their frequencies.

3. **Activity Selection:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

4. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins):** Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations. (Note:  This is a *variation* that can be solved greedily under specific conditions)


**Project Structure:**

- `src/`: Contains the TypeScript implementation.
- `test/`: Contains Jest test cases.
- `docs/`: Contains algorithm explanations, diagrams, and interview tips.
- `benchmark/`: Contains performance benchmarking code.
