# Heap Operations Coding Interview Project

This project contains several coding challenges related to heap data structures.  Each problem includes optimal solutions and sometimes alternative approaches.  Test cases are provided to ensure correctness.

**Problems:**

1. **Heapify:**  Convert an unsorted array into a min-heap.
2. **Kth Largest Element:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array using a min-heap.
3. **Merge K Sorted Lists:** Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list using a min-heap.
4. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Find the top k frequent elements in an array using a min-heap.
