Remember to install TypeScript (`npm install -g typescript`) and compile the code using `tsc`.  Then run the tests using a testing framework like Jest (you'll need to install it: `npm install --save-dev jest`).  This is a basic framework.  You can extend it with more problems, detailed testing, benchmarking, and different implementation approaches as described in your request.  The `Merge K Sorted Lists` problem requires a more complex data structure (linked list) and is left as an exercise for you to add to this foundation.  You can also expand on the error handling and edge case considerations in both the code and documentation. Remember to add appropriate error handling and input validation to make your code robust.
