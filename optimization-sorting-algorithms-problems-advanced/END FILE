This is a partial implementation.  You would need to fill in the missing implementation details for the sorting algorithms, test cases, and documentation. Remember to handle edge cases (empty arrays, duplicate elements, etc.) in your implementations and test cases.  The use of a testing framework like Google Test is highly recommended.  You can significantly extend this example to reach the 1000+ lines of code requirement by implementing the remaining algorithms and problems fully. Remember to add proper error handling and input validation to make your code robust.
