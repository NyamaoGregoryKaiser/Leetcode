# Sorting Algorithms Interview Project

This project explores various sorting algorithms and their applications through several problems.  Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.

## Problems:

1. **Array Sorting:** Sort a given array of integers in ascending order.  Explore different algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).

2. **Kth Smallest Element:** Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. Implement solutions using QuickSelect and Heap.

3. **Sort a Nearly Sorted Array:**  Given an array where each element is at most k positions away from its sorted position, sort the array efficiently.

4. **Sort a Linked List:** Sort a singly linked list in ascending order. Implement Merge Sort for linked lists.

5. **Meeting Rooms II:** (Advanced) Given an array of meeting time intervals `[[start, end], ...]`, determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required to accommodate all meetings. (This problem leverages sorting as a preprocessing step).
