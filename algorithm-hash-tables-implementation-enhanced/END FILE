Remember to install the Google Test framework (`gtest`) to run the unit tests.  This expanded structure provides a solid starting point for your comprehensive hash table interview project.  You'll need to fill in the implementation details for the problem solutions and the unit tests.  Consider adding more sophisticated hash functions and handling collisions more robustly in a production-ready implementation.  Remember to add the necessary include statements and link the libraries for compilation.
