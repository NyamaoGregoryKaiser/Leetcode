# Hash Table Interview Project

This project contains implementations of various hash table algorithms and related problems, designed for coding interview preparation.

## Problems:

1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.  Assume only one solution exists.
2. **Valid Anagram:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.
3. **Group Anagrams:** Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
4. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:** Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
5. **Minimum Window Substring:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`.  If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string "".
