# Hash Table Algorithms

This document explains the algorithms used in the Hash Table Interview Project.

## 1. Two Sum

**Algorithm:** Use a hash table to store each number and its index. Iterate through the array, and for each number, check if the complement (`target - num`) exists in the hash table.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)


## 2. Valid Anagram

**Algorithm:** Use a hash table to count the frequency of each character in both strings. Compare the frequency counts.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (assuming a limited character set)
