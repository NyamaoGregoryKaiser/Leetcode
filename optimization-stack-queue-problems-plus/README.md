# Stack and Queue Interview Problems

This project contains various problems related to stacks and queues, implemented in JavaScript. Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.

## Problems:

1. **Valid Parentheses:** Given a string containing parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`, determine if the input string is valid.  An input string is valid if:
    * Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    * Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    * Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket.

2. **Queue using Stacks:** Implement a queue data structure using two stacks.  The queue should support `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.

3. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:** Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed using the bars.

4. **Implement a LRU Cache:** Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache using a combination of a doubly linked list and a hashmap. The cache should support `get` and `set` operations.

5. **Rotten Oranges:** Given a grid of oranges, where 1 represents a fresh orange and 2 represents a rotten orange, determine the minimum number of minutes it takes for all fresh oranges to rot.  Oranges rot only when they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a rotten orange.
