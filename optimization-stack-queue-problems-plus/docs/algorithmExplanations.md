This document provides detailed explanations of the algorithms used in the project.

### Valid Parentheses:

This problem utilizes a stack to efficiently track opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, the stack is checked to ensure the corresponding opening bracket exists and is at the top.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case (all opening brackets).
