Remember to install necessary testing frameworks (like Mocha and Chai) and run `npm test` to execute the tests.  This is a framework; you need to flesh out the implementations and tests for all problems and add the benchmarking code and comprehensive documentation.  The LRU Cache and Rotten Oranges problems, in particular, require more complex implementations. Remember to handle edge cases (empty input, null values, etc.) thoroughly in your code.
