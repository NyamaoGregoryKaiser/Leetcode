This is a skeletal structure. You need to add more comprehensive test cases,  benchmarking code,  and potentially more sophisticated helper functions in `utils.h`. Remember to compile and run the code using a C++ compiler (like g++).  This expanded framework will help you create the complete 1000+ line project as requested.  The additional implementation files (brute force, memory-efficient versions) would involve creating alternative functions for each problem and comparing their performance.  Remember to add appropriate error handling and input validation for a robust project.
