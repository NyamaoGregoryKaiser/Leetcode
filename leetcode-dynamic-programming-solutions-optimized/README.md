# Dynamic Programming Interview Problems

This project contains several dynamic programming problems with their solutions. Each problem includes different approaches, time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

## Problems:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **0/1 Knapsack:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two).
4. **Coin Change:** Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.


## Project Structure:

- `dp_algorithms.cpp`: Contains the implementations of the DP algorithms.
- `test_dp.cpp`: Contains unit tests for the algorithms.
- `utils.h`: Helper functions and data structures.
- `benchmark.cpp`: Performance benchmarking code.
- `README.md`: This file.
