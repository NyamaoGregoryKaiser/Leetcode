# Math Problems Coding Interview Project

This project contains solutions to several mathematical problems frequently encountered in coding interviews.  Each problem includes multiple approaches with time and space complexity analysis.

## Problems:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:**  Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **Prime Number Check:** Determine if a given number is a prime number.
3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Find the greatest common divisor of two integers.
4. **Factorial:** Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
5. **Power Calculation:** Calculate x raised to the power of n (x^n).


## Project Structure:

- `math_problems.py`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test_math_problems.py`: Unit tests.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions (if needed).
