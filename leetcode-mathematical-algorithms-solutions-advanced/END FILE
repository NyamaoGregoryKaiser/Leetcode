This is a starting point.  To reach 1000+ lines, you would add more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci, more advanced primality tests), implement different programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented), add detailed documentation with diagrams, and incorporate comprehensive performance benchmarking.  Remember to add error handling and edge case considerations throughout your code.
