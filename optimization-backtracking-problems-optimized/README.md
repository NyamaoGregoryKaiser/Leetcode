# Backtracking Algorithms

This project explores several backtracking problems with different approaches and optimizations.

**Problems:**

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subsets:** Find all possible subsets of a given set.
3. **Permutations:** Generate all unique permutations of a given string.
4. **Combination Sum:** Find all unique combinations of candidates that add up to a target number.
5. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.


**Structure:**

* `src/backtracking.ts`: Main algorithm implementations.
* `src/__tests__/backtracking.test.ts`: Test cases.
* `src/utils.ts`: Helper functions and data structures.
* `docs/algorithm_explanation.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations.
