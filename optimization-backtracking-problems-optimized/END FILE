This is a simplified framework.  Remember to add the remaining problems (Permutations, Combination Sum, Sudoku Solver),  implement thorough test cases,  add performance benchmarking, and expand the documentation significantly to reach the 1000+ line goal.  Consider using a more robust testing framework like Jest and explore different backtracking approaches (e.g., iterative vs. recursive) within each problem.  Also, include examples of brute-force solutions for comparison.
