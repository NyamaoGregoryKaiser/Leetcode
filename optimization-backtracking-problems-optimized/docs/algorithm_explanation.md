# Backtracking Algorithm Explanation

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all solutions to a problem.  It incrementally builds candidates and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.

**Key Concepts:**

* **State Space:** The set of all possible configurations or states.
* **Candidate Solutions:** Partial solutions that are being built incrementally.
* **Constraints:** Rules that determine whether a candidate is valid.
* **Pruning:** Eliminating branches of the search tree that cannot lead to a solution.


**(Detailed explanations for each problem, including visual diagrams (ASCII art), edge cases, and gotchas would go here.  This would be a significant portion of the documentation.)**

For example, for N-Queens, you'd illustrate the state space, show how constraints (no two queens attacking each other) are applied, and describe how pruning avoids exploring invalid board configurations.
