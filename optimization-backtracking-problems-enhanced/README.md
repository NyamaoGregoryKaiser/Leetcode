# Backtracking Algorithms Project

This project demonstrates various backtracking algorithms with multiple approaches and optimizations.  Each problem includes detailed explanations, test cases, and performance analysis.

## Problems:

1. **N-Queens:** Place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Subset Sum:** Find all subsets of a given array that sum up to a target value.
3. **Sudoku Solver:** Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle.
4. **Combination Sum:** Find all unique combinations of numbers from a given array that sum up to a target value.
5. **Graph Coloring:** Assign colors to nodes in a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.


## Project Structure:

- `src/`: Contains the main algorithm implementations and helper functions.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for each algorithm.
- `docs/`: Contains algorithm explanations, diagrams, and interview tips.
- `benchmark/`: Contains performance benchmarking code.


## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., using npm or yarn).
3. Run the tests.
4. Explore the source code and documentation.
