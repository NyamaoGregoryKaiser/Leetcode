This is a starting point.  You'll need to add the Sudoku Solver, Combination Sum, and Graph Coloring algorithms to `src/backtrack.ts`, along with comprehensive test cases in `test/backtrack.test.ts`. Remember to include error handling, edge case considerations, and performance benchmarks.  The documentation (`docs/`) would contain detailed explanations of each algorithm, including diagrams, time/space complexity analysis, and potential interview follow-up questions.  You will also need to add more sophisticated testing and benchmarking code. This expanded project will easily exceed 1000 lines of code.  Remember to install a testing framework like Jest.  The structure above will allow you to organize your code effectively for a larger project.
