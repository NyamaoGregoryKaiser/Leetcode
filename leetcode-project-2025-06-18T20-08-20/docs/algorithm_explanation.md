# Heap Algorithm Explanation

This document explains the core concepts behind heap data structures and the algorithms used in this project.

## Heap Properties:

* **Heap-ordered:**  A heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.  In a min-heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children.  In a max-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its children.

* **Complete Binary Tree:** A heap is typically implemented as a complete binary tree, meaning all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

## Heap Operations:

* **Insertion:**  Adding a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.  This involves adding the element to the end of the underlying array and then "heapifying up" to restore the heap property.

* **Extraction:** Removing the root element (minimum in a min-heap, maximum in a max-heap) and restoring the heap property.  This involves replacing the root with the last element, and then "heapifying down" to restore the heap property.

* **Heapify Up/Down:** These are helper functions used to restore the heap property after insertion or extraction.  They involve comparing the value of a node with its children (or parent) and swapping them if necessary.
