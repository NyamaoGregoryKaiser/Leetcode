# Sorting Algorithms Interview Project

This project explores various sorting algorithms and their applications.  It includes implementations, tests, and analyses for several problems.

**Problems:**

1. **Array Sorting:** Sort an array of numbers in ascending order.  Explore different algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) and compare their performance.
2. **Kth Smallest Element:** Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.
3. **Sort a Linked List:** Sort a singly linked list using Merge Sort.
4. **Sort an array of objects by a specific property:** Sort an array of objects based on a given property (e.g., sorting users by age).
5. **Stable Sorting:** Implement a stable sorting algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort) to maintain the relative order of equal elements.


**Algorithms Implemented:**

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort


**Project Structure:**

* `src/`: Contains the algorithm implementations and supporting files.
* `test/`: Contains unit tests.
* `docs/`: Contains documentation and diagrams.


**Running the Tests:**  (Instructions will depend on your testing framework - example using Jest)
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
