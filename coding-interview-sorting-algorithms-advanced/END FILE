This provides a solid foundation.  Remember to add more thorough implementations (especially for Heap Sort and QuickSelect),  extensive test cases for all functions, performance benchmarks,  and complete documentation including diagrams as outlined in the README.  This expanded project will easily surpass 1000 lines of code.  Consider using a testing framework like Jest and a benchmarking library for a professional touch. Remember to handle edge cases properly in your implementations.
