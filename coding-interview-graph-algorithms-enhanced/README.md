# Graph Algorithms Interview Project

This project contains implementations of various graph algorithms, along with test cases and performance benchmarks.  Each problem includes multiple approaches and analyses of time/space complexity.

**Problems:**

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Perform a topological sort and detect cycles.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
4. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):** Find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph.
5. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Find the shortest path in a weighted graph with potential negative edge weights.


**Project Structure:**

- `graph.js`: Main graph implementation and algorithms.
- `test.js`: Test cases using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions (e.g., adjacency list creation).
- `benchmark.js`: Performance benchmarking.
- `algorithms.md`: Detailed algorithm explanations and diagrams.
