This is a starting point. You would need to significantly expand the `graph.js` file to include complete implementations of Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Bellman-Ford algorithms, along with comprehensive test cases in `test.js`. You should also add the `benchmark.js` file and  a well-structured `algorithms.md` file with diagrams and explanations. Remember to install Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`) for running the tests.  This expanded project would comfortably exceed 1000 lines of code.  Remember to handle edge cases and error conditions robustly in your implementations.
