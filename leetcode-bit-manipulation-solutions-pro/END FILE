Remember to install Node.js and run `node test.js` to execute the test cases.  This is a foundational structure; you can extend it significantly by adding more algorithms, comprehensive test cases, benchmarking code, different programming paradigms (e.g., functional programming), and memory-efficient versions as requested.  Remember to handle edge cases properly and add comprehensive comments for better understanding.
