# Bit Manipulation Algorithms

This project contains implementations of several bit manipulation algorithms in JavaScript.  Each algorithm includes multiple approaches (where applicable), time/space complexity analysis, and test cases.

**Algorithms Included:**

1. **Count Set Bits:** Counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer.
2. **Reverse Bits:** Reverses the order of bits in an integer.
3. **Find the Only Non-Repeating Number:** Finds the single number that appears only once in an array where all other numbers appear twice.
4. **Check if a Number is a Power of 2:** Determines if a given number is a power of 2.
5. **Swap Two Numbers without using a temporary variable:** Swaps the values of two variables without using an extra variable.


**Project Structure:**

- `algorithms.js`: Contains the implementations of the bit manipulation algorithms.
- `test.js`: Contains test cases for the algorithms.
- `utils.js`: Contains helper functions (if needed).
- `benchmark.js`: (Optional) Contains code for performance benchmarking.
- `documentation.md`: Detailed explanations, diagrams, and edge cases.
