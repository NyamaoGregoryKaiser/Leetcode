**To Compile and Run this project:**

1.  **Save the files:** Create a directory named `dp_interview_project`. Inside it, create `src`, `test`, `doc`, `utils`, and `bin` subdirectories as shown in the structure. Copy the content of each file into its respective path.
    *   `dp_interview_project/src/dp_problems.hpp`
    *   `dp_interview_project/src/dp_problems.cpp`
    *   `dp_interview_project/src/main.cpp`
    *   `dp_interview_project/test/test_dp_problems.cpp`
    *   `dp_interview_project/doc/README.md`
    *   `dp_interview_project/doc/DP_Concepts.md`
    *   `dp_interview_project/utils/timer.hpp`
    *   `dp_interview_project/LICENSE` (optional, but good practice)

2.  **Navigate to the `dp_interview_project` directory** in your terminal.

3.  **Compile the main executable:**
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Isrc -Iutils src/dp_problems.cpp src/main.cpp -o bin/dp_main
    ```

4.  **Run the main executable (demonstration & benchmarks):**
    ```bash
    ./bin/dp_main
    ```

5.  **Compile the test executable:**
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -g -Isrc -Iutils test/test_dp_problems.cpp src/dp_problems.cpp -o bin/dp_tests
    ```

6.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/dp_tests
    ```

This setup provides a complete, working, and well-documented project to prepare for Dynamic Programming interview questions.
