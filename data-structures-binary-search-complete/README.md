# Binary Search Project

This project explores the Binary Search algorithm and its variations through several problems.  It includes optimized solutions, brute-force approaches, and performance benchmarks.

**Problems:**

1. **Standard Binary Search:** Find the index of a target value in a sorted array.
2. **Find First and Last Occurrence:** Find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a target value in a sorted array.
3. **Find Closest Element:** Find the element in a sorted array that is closest to a given target value.
4. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array:** Find a target value in a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot point.
5. **Search Range in Sorted Matrix:** Given a sorted matrix, find the range (row, column) of a target value.
