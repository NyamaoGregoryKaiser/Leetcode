# Binary Search Algorithm Explanation

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a *sorted* array.  It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half. This process continues until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
