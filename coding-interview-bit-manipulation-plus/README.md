# Bit Manipulation Coding Interview Problems

This project contains several coding problems focusing on bit manipulation techniques.  Each problem includes multiple solutions with varying time and space complexities.

**Problems:**

1. **Counting Set Bits:** Count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer.
2. **Reverse Bits:** Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.
3. **Single Number:** Find the single number that appears an odd number of times in an array (all others appear even times).
4. **Swap Odd and Even Bits:** Swap the odd and even bits of an integer.


**Project Structure:**

- `src/main/java/BitManipulation.java`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `src/test/java/BitManipulationTest.java`: Unit tests.
- `src/main/java/Utils.java`: Helper utilities.


**To Run:**

1.  Make sure you have Java and a build tool like Maven or Gradle set up.
2.  Compile and run the tests using your preferred build tool.
