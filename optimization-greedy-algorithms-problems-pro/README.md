# Greedy Algorithms Project

This project contains implementations of various greedy algorithms in JavaScript. Each problem includes multiple approaches (where applicable), complexity analysis, and test cases.

**Problems:**

1. **Fractional Knapsack:** Given a set of items with weights and values, determine the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack with a weight capacity.
2. **Huffman Coding:** Construct an optimal prefix-free binary code for a given set of characters and their frequencies.
3. **Activity Selection:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
4. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins):** Find the minimum number of coins to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations.


**Project Structure:**

- `greedy.js`: Main algorithm implementations.
- `test.js`: Test cases using Jest.
- `utils.js`: Helper functions.
